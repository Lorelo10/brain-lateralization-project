## Project Summary
This repository contains the code, materials, and documentation for my Master’s thesis project titled:
“MEASURING BRAIN ACTIVITY GENERATED BY EMOTIONAL STIMULATION WITH DOPPLER ULTRASOUND. ”

The objective of this project was to explore hemispheric lateralization patterns of emotional processing during vigilance tasks, using Transcranial Doppler Sonography (TCD) to assess cerebral blood flow velocities in the left and right middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). The experimental paradigm was developed using PsychoPy, and data analysis was performed with Excel and R.

## Repository Contents
experiment/: PsychoPy experiment files (.psyexp and related assets)
data/: Example dataset (anonymized)
analysis/: Scripts used for statistical analysis (R and Excel)
report/: Final PDF of the thesis document.

## Tools & Technologies
PsychoPy: For experimental design and stimulus presentation.
Excel: For preprocessing and basic data handling.
R & SPSS: For statistical analysis and data visualization.
TCD Equipment: For real-time monitoring of cerebral blood flow.

## Main Contributions
Design of a vigilance task paradigm for emotional lateralization.
Integration of experimental psychology tools with physiological data acquisition.
Application of Doppler ultrasound in a cognitive neuroscience context.
Statistical evaluation of hemispheric dominance patterns for emotion.

## Some results

The data for the dependent variable depression are parametric. The results indicate that for the intra-subject effects test there are significant differences in the levels of depression between pre and post at a general level among the participants, F(1,19)=11,852; p<.001; η2=0.461. In the inter-subject effects test, significant differences were also found between the groups regardless of the moment, F(1,19)=10.172; p<.005; η2=0.349. Again, higher levels of depression are observed in participants in the sad induction group even before the induction and before knowing which group they would be assigned to. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to compare differences between pre and post group by group. As seen in Image 7. The results found indicate that for the sad induction group the increase in depression is significant, F(1,10)=16,194; p<.002; η2=0.618, comparing the pre and post induction moments. For the happy induction group there was a decrease in depression, comparing the pre-moment (mean = 1.2, SD = 1.26) with the post-induction moment (mean = 1.05, SD = 1.27) but this difference is not significant (p<. 217).
